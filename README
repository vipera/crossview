NAME

    crossview - Wrapper for VNC over a common SSH host

SYNOPSIS

    Usage: crossview [-c] [-s] [-i] [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [-p port]
    [-d X session] [--password password] [--viewonly]
    [user[:password]@]host[:port]

    To start the server, specify a display to share and an SSH proxy over
    which to allow the connection:

    marin@ananas:~$ crossview -s -d 0 user@hostname Run crossview on client
    with the following options: crossview -c -p 9000 [USER@]hostname

    You can now run the client application to connect to the server via the
    given port and SSH host.

    ivana@pelikan:~$ crossview -c -p 9000 user@hostname

DESCRIPTION

    CrossView allows a desktop X session to be shared via an SSH proxy
    server with another computer. First, x11vnc(1) will be started. Using
    ssh(1), a connection will be established towards another computer and
    the local port used for connecting to X11VNC will be forwarded. Another
    crossview user connecting to the SSH proxy can connect to the session,
    thereby bypassing any NAT or firewalls that would impede a direct
    connection.

    The synopsis above gives a basic working example. Try crossview --help
    for more information or see the CrossView::Simple manual page.

OPTIONS

    -s Start in server mode (share a desktop) -c Start in client mode
    (connect to a desktop) -i Use public key / passphrase authentication
    towards the SSH server instead of username/password. -h, --help Show
    program help -v, --version Show program version -p Client mode only.
    Connect to specified forwarded port on proxy server. To connect to a
    different SSH port (not 22), use the hostname:port notation when
    specifying the SSH proxy's address. -d Server mode only. Use the
    specified X session for displaying. The current desktop is usually 0 or
    1, but this may vary depending on your settings. --password Server mode
    only. Use the specified password for the VNC session. Provides
    additional security against people logged into the SSH proxy from
    viewing other sessions. --viewonly Server mode only. Specify that a
    session is to be viewed only, with mouse and keyboard events not
    propagated to the target host.
