NAME

    crossview - Wrapper for VNC over a common SSH host

SYNOPSIS

    Usage:

      crossview [-c] [-s] [-i] [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [-p PORT_NO]
      [-d X_DISPLAY] [--password PASSWORD] [--no-pw] [--viewonly] [--pick-window]
      [-w|--window-id X_WINDOW_ID] [USER[:PASSWORD]@]HOST[:PORT]

    To start the server, specify a display to share and an SSH proxy over
    which to allow the connection:

    marin@ananas:~$ crossview -s -d 0 user@hostname Run crossview on client
    with the following options: crossview -c -p 9000 [USER@]hostname

    You can now run the client application to connect to the server via the
    given port and SSH host.

    ivana@pelikan:~$ crossview -c -p 9000 user@hostname

DESCRIPTION

    CrossView allows a desktop X session to be shared via an SSH proxy
    server with another computer. First, x11vnc(1) will be started. Using
    ssh(1), a connection will be established towards another computer and
    the local port used for connecting to X11VNC will be forwarded. Another
    crossview user connecting to the SSH proxy can connect to the session,
    thereby bypassing any NAT or firewalls that would impede a direct
    connection.

    The synopsis above gives a basic working example. Try crossview --help
    for more information or see the crossview manual page.

OPTIONS

    -s

        Start in server mode (share a desktop)

    -c

        Start in client mode (connect to a desktop)

    -i

        Use key/passphrase authentication towards the SSH server instead of
        username/password.

    -h, --help

        Show program help

    -v, --version

        Show program version

    -p

        Client mode only. Connect to specified forwarded port on proxy server. To
        connect to a different SSH port (not 22), use the hostname:port notation
        when specifying the SSH proxy's address.

    -d

        Server mode only. Use the specified X session for displaying. The current
        desktop is usually 0 or 1, but this may vary depending on your settings.

    --password

        Server mode only. Use the specified password for the VNC session. Provides
        additional security against people logged into the SSH proxy from viewing
        other sessions. If not specified, a randomly-generated eight-character
        password will be used. If you do not want a password to be used, use the
        --no-pw option.

    --no-pw

        Server mode only. Explicitly run the VNC server without a password.

    --viewonly

        Server mode only. Specify that a session is to be viewed only, with mouse
        and keyboard events not propagated to the target host.

    --pick-window

        Server mode only. Will launch the xwininfo(1) tool for graphically selecting
        a window to be shared. Remote clients will only be able to see this window.

    -w, --window-id

        Share only window with the specified Window ID. A Window ID is in hex format
        like 0xaabbccdd which can be obtained through the use of tools such as
        xwininfo(1). To choose a window without specifying its ID, see the
        --pick-window option.

    --new-x-session DISPLAY

        Start a new nested X session using Xephyr. The program will try to detect
        the local desktop environment and launch a session of the same type. The
        session will be started on the port :DISPLAY.
