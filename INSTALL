CrossView

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL

You may be told by the previous command that there are dependencies you need to
install in order to continue. If so, install them with:

    ./Build installdeps

This should install any Perl modules that are required directly from CPAN.
You should now proceed with the installation normally:

    ./Build
    ./Build install

After that, crossview should be available as a command from /usr/bin or your
default installation location:

    crossview --version
